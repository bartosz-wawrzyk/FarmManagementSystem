# FarmManagementSystem

A small farm management system is a project that is used to support the technical and
logical user working on the land. Based on the comparison of various systems that are available
and the problems that occur in the economies, the entire application was designed based on
technologies that build desktop applications. The program has operations related to data
management, calculations or creating a sowing plan for the next year.

Application written in JavaFX and database MySQL


The registration and login screen looks the same, it differs in the data that the application requires from the user

One menu is presented, while each of the options ("Garaż/Garage", "Hodowla/Breeding", "Magazyn/Warehouse", "Przychody/Income", "Wydatki/Expenses", "Działki/Plots") has an identical interface, which differs in the data and values that are required by the system to manipulate the data.

The calculator is divided into several options and regardless of species or variety user can count needed information. The farmer can use it at each type of crop he uses, however, he must enter key data.

The seeding plan module for next year is clear and quickly calculates everything
the user needs to know. After generating the plot number in the smaller window
and the name of the crop next to it, a new crop is generated that can be sown on the given one
field. The whole thing is generated as an example plan that a farmer can use. If
a given plan does not suit him, maybe by clicking "Calculate" again
generate a plan. This module is designed to show different sowing possibilities
and quick generation of all sorts of ways a farmer can plan sowing on
all next year.
